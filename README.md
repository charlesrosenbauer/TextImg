TextImg

---

This is a C TUI library that I use for various personal projects and for projects for [The American Compute Company](https://uscompco.com).

The code is presented as-is. Some stuff in here I use all the time, other stuff I built once and never really used. It's just a couple files I copy frequently between projects that slowly mutates.

I do have some other files that add various higher-level stuff like buttons and text entry, but that's not included here at the moment.

There's a function in there that bakes codepage 437 into your executable file.
